![agri-tech360_logo]()

In this Flutter application, we leverage the power of machine learning models to accurately classify plant diseases and pests. By integrating ML algorithms into our app, we provide farmers and gardeners with a convenient and efficient way to identify and address plant health issues. Our app uses high-quality ML models that have been trained on vast datasets of plant images, enabling us to provide accurate and reliable results. With our app, users can easily capture images of their plants using their smartphone cameras, and our ML models will quickly analyze the images to identify any potential diseases or pests. Our app also provides recommendations for the best course of action based on the identified issue, helping users to take swift and effective action to protect their crops. Overall, our Flutter application is a powerful tool for anyone looking to maintain healthy and thriving plants.
