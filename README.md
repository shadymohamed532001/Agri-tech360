## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
### Adding new icons

- Icon size must be 400x400px.
- You can make fork and edit this file in browser by adding new icon and make Pull Request.
- Just click "edit" sign or click [here](https://github.com/marwin1991/profile-technology-icons/edit/main/README.md).
- To add a new icon, copy a boilerplate code from any other single icon, drag&drop the new icon right to the editor and change the path of the old icon to the new one.
